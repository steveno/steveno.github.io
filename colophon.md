### Technical

This blog is hosted using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com). I use
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate everything.

### Theme

I am using a slightly modified version of default theme minima. My modifications
to the theme are pretty minor. A few minor changes in the `_scss` directory,
like colors and font sizes. I am using [CormorantGaramond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cormorant+Garamond)
as the main font and [Hack](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack) for all of
the code blocks.
