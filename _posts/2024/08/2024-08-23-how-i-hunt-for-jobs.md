I presently am finding myself in the unenviable position of needing to look for
a new job. It is by no means an enjoyable task, and it is one that has taken me
quite a while to really get the hang of. While I have never worked as a
recruiter, I have, in my opinion, acquired quite a bit of wisdom about how this
process works (in the United States anyway).

## Process

For starters, I generally avoid job aggregators. Your typical fare like
Monster, Indeed, Dice, etc. have never really worked out well for me. I am sure
there are good jobs on there, and that people do get good jobs from those sites
on a daily basis, but that's never been me. I find that more often than not
sites like those are overrun with third party recruiters. The posting that
aren't third party recruiters recieve _thousands_ of applications, a lot of
which, again I am guessing, are automatically submitted by bots.

I instead stick to applying to jobs directly on company websites. This
guarantees me that the post is a real job, and it helps me avoid scams. The
tricky part here is finding the companies you need to go to, to look for open
roles. There are a lot of ways of doing this. I usually start with names I
know. From there I look at competitors. When that runs out I look up things
like "Largest tech firms by market cap" or something similar. If big companies
aren't your thing I'm sure there are other similar Google searches you could
perform to help you find places. It's also smart to just keep a list of places
even when you are not hunting. Stumble upon a neat looking software company?
Write them down. You never know when you might need to apply for a job.

Another thing that I like to do is keep all of the logins I have for places I
have applied to. I have seen a lot of people moan on the internet about this
but, in my opinion, it isn't that big a deal. I use KeePassXC. I have a folder
devoted to "Job Sites." There are downsides to this. A lot of times I end up
getting two search results for a lot of my logins. One for the company and one
for their career site. That's a minor annoyance at worst. The other minor
annoyance is that I commonly find that companies will delete my account or
invalidate my password. I have no idea why this happens, but it does happen
sometimes. The major advantage to this method for me, though, is that, as
of this writing, I have over **165** companies that I don't have to think
of that I can look into applying to again.

## Resume

Your resume is unquestionably important. Once you finish writing it, have more
than one person look over it for you. I really want to stress that proof
reading is vital here. You want it to be as perfect as possible to convey that
you have really good attention to detail. Speaking of which, consistency is
also very important. For example, if you are listing items for a position you
have held, and one bullet ends with a period, then every bullet item needs to
end with a period - for every position you list. Again consistency is key.

You should also be aware of formatting. I like to put an objective statement at
the top of my resume and a short list of skills above my experience. This gives
recruiters a quick area to glance over as they look for specific
keywords/skills that are applicable to the role they're trying to fill. Then
your professional experience, followed by by your certifications. Depending on
the specific field you are applying to be in, these may or may not be something
you need to invest in. The final thing on my resume is my education. With the
most recent degree first. 

Finally, some things to avoid. I would avoid putting your picture on it. In the
modern era, I almost feel like this has become taboo. I would also avoid a lot
of fancy graphics or emojis. Your resume should stand out, but not be
distracting!

## Cover Letter

I don't feel like there is too much to cover here. Again, have multiple people
help you proof read your letter. The market, as of this writing, is really
tough and you don't want to miss an opportunity because you missed a period. I
recommend you keep your letter to less than one page. These are things
recruiters and hiring managers are going to glance over and maybe read, but if
your cover letter is a two page wall of text, I can promise you they'll skip it
altogether.

## Conclusion

The reality of all of this is that job hunting sucks. Its demoralizing and
agonizing. It doesn't have to be the worst though. With practice and patience,
you can make it through the process and end up happy on the other side!
