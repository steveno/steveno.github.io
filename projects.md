### [balística](https://github.com/fusilero/balistica)

An open source ballistics calculator. Written in [Vala](https://vala.dev/), it
was the originally translated from a project written in C named GNU Exterior
Ballistics Computer ([GEBC](https://github.com/fusilero/gebc)).

### [libbalistica](https://github.com/fusilero/libbalistica)

After writing balística, I decided to break it apart and make the actual
ballistics calculations be a library, leaving balística as just a GUI that used
libbalistica on the backend.

### [pólvora](https://github.com/fusilero/polvora)

pólvora originated a reloading database. Sadly the project never reached a
workable state.
